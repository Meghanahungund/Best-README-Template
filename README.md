## About The Project

The lane detection system presented in this paper is intended to improve the safety and
 effectiveness of self-driving car navigation. The framework uses high-resolution photos
 taken by onboard cameras to precisely identify and categorize lane borders using
 computer vision algorithms.
  The effectiveness and reliability of the framework are validated by thorough
 evaluation of deformable CNN model. This lane identification framework enhances road
 safety, efficiency, and user experience, which makes a substantial contribution to the
 advancement of autonomous vehicle technology
